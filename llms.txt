## Overview

**vif** is a screen capture and browser automation toolkit for macOS, designed specifically for AI agents and LLMs.

## Quickstart

Get up and running with vif in under 5 minutes.

## Browser Automation

vif provides Chrome automation via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). The API is inspired by Stagehand but runs locally without external AI inference costs.

## Scene DSL

Define demo sequences declaratively in YAML. Scenes automate cursor movement, clicks, typing, overlays, and recording.

## MCP Tools

vif exposes all its capabilities as MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, allowing Claude Code to control screen capture, overlays, and browser automation directly.
